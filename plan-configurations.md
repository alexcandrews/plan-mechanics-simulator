Plan Configurations
Member Strategy

Self Paced
- Every member starts on their own time
Scheduled
- All group start at the same time

Unlocking Strategy
- Unlock by start date passed
- Unlock by completion of prior milestones
- Unlock by completion of all current unlocked milestones (current)
- Unlock by start date passed and completion of prior (non-optional) milestones

Completion Strategy (I don't think the simulator needs to worry about this)
- Complete milestones when all activities are clicked
- Complete milestones when all activities are completed
- Complete milestones when only assessment activities are completed

Comms Reminders Strategy
- Notify Milestone Pending Completion once
- Notify Milestone Pending Completion twice

Flags
- Use Due Dates
- Always unlock session milestones

Optional Milestones:
Do not contribute in completion of the plan/milestones
Do not contribute in unlocking of the plan/milestones
States: Locked - Unlocked - Completed
When M1 is completed [M1, M2(Optional), M3(Optional), M4, M5]
unlock all next sequential Optional Milestones (M2, M3)
unlock the next 1 (non-optional) Milestone (M4)
Open Questions
Navigation?
Confusion of What UX would look like if optional milestones are not completed?


Navigation Ideas:
Land members on milestone that starts today
Introduce a milestone “started” state
Maybe could be useful to navigate the user to the latest  started milestone
Maybe could be useful for tracking engagement as admin admin overrides like “Unlock for all members” does not indicate if the member even attempted to open the page
